# Vertex 2.0
A version of VERTEX that includes synaptic plasticity and electric field stimulation options. 

To explore these options try out the tutorial_5_TBSStimulation and tutorial_5_PPstimulation.

The code to setup and run the rat neocortex model from the paper:
"The Virtual Electrode Recording Tool for EXtracellular Potentials (VERTEX) Version 2.0: 
Modelling \emph{in vitro} electrical stimulation of brain tissue"
can be found in the ratSomatosensoryCortex directory. To run these simulations you will run the 
loadandrunrat.m script. This will setup the model and run the simulation. 

You will need to modify this code where specified to set the parameters for the simulation,
so comment in the correct lines for a single pulse stimulation run, a paired pulse run, 
and a theta burst stimulation run.

You will also need to specify the
